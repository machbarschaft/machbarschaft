## What is it?
Machbarschaft is a project that has been created while <a href="https://wirvsvirushackathon.org/">WirVsVirus hackathon</a> which took part from 20.03.2020 to 22.03.2020. 
The aim of this project is providing help for people which have to stay at home in quarantine and have no access to the internet. For those people we have created Machbarschaft. It is a phone number that people can call. Here they can provide information what they need, how urgent this work is and personal information. Those data is collected and provided in an app where other users see those orders. They can get in touch with those people and fulfil this order so that the caller has not to leave his house or apartment.
